# RefactorProject
The objective of the project is to reengineer the Minnesota Income Tax Calculator application to improve its design as more flexible and maintainable design

The refactored application will serve the same purpose as the legacy application, which is to calculate
the income tax of Minnesota state citizens based on their marital status, income, and receipts.
However, the refactored version will have a more flexible and maintainable design, making it easier
to modify and extend in the future.
The refactored design will also address the identified problems of the legacy application, such as
unnecessary complexity, duplicate code, and large classes with many responsibilities.
